On this site, I talk occasionally about the technology, tools, and workflow behind my photography. My actual photography is on display at a few other sites I run:

* **[146 Parks](https://146parks.blog)**: My effort to visit every state park in Washington state.
* **[Eric Scouten :: Travel](https://ericscouten.travel)**: Memories from various travels around the US and the world.
* **[This Is North Kitsap](https://thisisnorthkitsap.com)**: Around my home in Kitsap County, Washington.

Hope you enjoy following along!
